Trying to format code blocks!

```powershell
this is formatted with md code block and powershell tag

function Write-Stuff {
    Write-Output $Stuff
}
```

Blah blah blah

```powershell
#this is formatted with md code block and powershell tag

function Write-Stuff {
    Write-Output $Stuff
}
```

```plaintext
Output with a class tag at the end
```
